ICRA 2015 Workshop on Innovative Sensing in Robotics, with 
Focus on Neuromorphic Sensors

May 30, 2015, morning 

http://innovative-sensing.mit.edu

This workshop covers innovative sensing devices, with 
particular focus on neuromorphic vision sensors, as well as 
the inference, learning, and control methods needed to 
take advantage of that hardware. 

The invited talks provide a tutorial on: 
* neuromorphic vision sensors
* spike-based and AER-based algorithms
* neuromorphic computation substrates (including memristors)
* neurobiology of insects' visual circuits

The speakers are:
* JÃ¶rg Conradt (TUM)
* Christian Brandli (IniLabs)
* Andrew Straw (IMP, Vienna)
* Mirko Prezioso (UCSB)
* Deepak Khosla (HRL Laboratories)

Contributed talks: we are looking forward to receiving 
any in-topic submissions including late-blooming results. 
Please submit a 1-page abstract, a full paper, or directly 
a set of slides to the organizers. 

Deadline: May 1 
Notification: May 8

Organizers:
* Andrea Censi (MIT) <censi@mit.edu>
* Davide Scaramuzza (University of Zurich) <sdavide@ifi.uzh.ch>
