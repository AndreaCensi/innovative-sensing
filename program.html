Dr. Liu (B.Sc. MIT; M.Sc. UCLA; Ph.D. Caltech, 1997) is Oberassistentin at the Institut für Neuroinformatik, University of Zürich/ETH Zürich and she is co-leader of the <a href="http://sensors.ini.uzh.ch/">Sensors group</a>. Dr. Liu obtained her Ph.D. in the Computation and Neural Systems Program at California Institute of Technology under the supervision of Dr. Carver Mead. For her Ph.D. thesis, she studied models of motion processing in the fly visual system and their subsequent implementation in silicon. She worked at the Rockwell Research International Laboratories in Thousand Oaks on various neuromorphic systems for commercial purposes, as well in a few others Silicon Valley companies.

            Prof. Dickinson (Ph.D., UW, 1989) is a leading expert in neuroethology and biomechanics. He received a Ph.D. in the Dept. of Zoology at UW in 1989. His dissertation project focused on the physiology of sensory cells on the wings of flies. It was this study of wing sensors that led to an interest in insect aerodynamics and flight control circuitry. He worked briefly at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, Germany, and served as an Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Anatomy at the University of Chicago in 1991. He moved to the University of California, Berkeley in 1996 and was appointed as the Williams Professor in the Department of Integrative Biology in 2000. From 2002 to 2010, he was the Esther and Abe Zarem Professor of Bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology. He currently holds the Benjamin Hall Endowed Chair in Basic Life Sciences at UW. Dickinson’s awards include the Larry Sandler Award from the Genetics Society of America, the Bartholemew Award for Comparative Physiology from the American Society of Zoologists, a Packard Foundation Fellowship in Science and Engineering, and the Quantrell award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching at the University of Chicago. In 2001, he was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. In 2008, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
