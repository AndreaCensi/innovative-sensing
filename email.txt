INNOVATIVE SENSING IN ROBOTICS - Focus on Neuromorphic Sensors
- an half-day workshop at ICRA 2015

Date: May 30, 2015, morning 
Web page: http://innovative-sensing.mit.edu

Description
-----------

This workshop covers innovative sensing devices, with 
particular focus on neuromorphic vision sensors, as well as 
the inference, learning, and control methods needed to 
take advantage of that hardware. 

Perception is still one of the main issues in robotics. 
In the past, leaps in the functionalities of robots 
were jumpstarted by the availability of new sensor types 
(the laser range-finder in early 2000s, the 3D cameras in the
2010s). So what will be next enabling technology in sensing? 

Topics of interest include the emerging field of neuromorphic
vision sensors (DVS, ATIS, etc.), which might be the technology 
enabling high performance yet low power small UAVs, as well as 
other unconventional vision systems (4D light field/polydioptrical 
cameras, template-based optical computing) and other currently 
under-utilized sensor modalities.


Invited talks
----------------

The invited talks as a whole will provide a coherent tutorial on: 
* neuromorphic vision sensors
* spike-based and AER-based algorithms
* neuromorphic computation substrates (including memristors)
* neurobiology of insects' visual circuits

The speakers are:
* Jörg Conradt (Technische Universität München)  
* Christian Brandli (IniLabs)
* Andrew Straw (Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna)
* Mirko Prezioso (UCSB)
* Deepak Khosla (HRL Laboratories)

Contributed talks
-------------------

We are looking forward to receive any in-topic submissions 
including late-blooming results. Please submit a 1-page abstract, 
a full paper, or directly a set of slides to the organizers. 

Deadline: May 1 
Notification: May 8
